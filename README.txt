Runtime Complexity:
    O(n*m) - Where n represents the length of each string in the array, and m is the length of the array.  The function,
            minDeletionSize(), has a for loop that loops n times, and a nested for loop within that which loops m times for each
            iteration of n.

Space Complexity:
    O(n) - Where n represents the length of an array -- the program stores an array of length n.
